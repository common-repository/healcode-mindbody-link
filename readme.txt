With our Login | Register Link, your clients will be able to stay on your website to manage their accounts and see their schedule.



== Description ==

**Now developers and non-developers alike can add MINDBODY login links to the main navigation menu!**

This plugin lets you add a Login | Register link to the right-most end of your navigation menu. This Link (also called the My Account link) will pull up the Consumer Cart, which allows your clients to login to their MINDBODY accounts from your website and to create new MINDBODY accounts from your website.

When you add in the [MINDBODY Widget](https://wordpress.org/plugins/healcode-mindbody-widget/ "MINDBODY Widget") plugin, your site can sync with your MINDBODY account to display MINDBODY information including classes, enrollments, appointments, staff biographies, class/enrollment descriptions, and more.

**NOTE** You will need a MINDBODY account to use this plugin. Visit [MINDBODY](https://www.mindbodyonline.com/ "MINDBODY") to sign up!

See our [MINDBODY Link Plugin FAQ](https://support.mindbodyonline.com/s/article/ka032000000LBU4AAO/Creating-links-with-branded-web-tools?language=en_US)

[Contact MINDBODY support](https://support.mindbodyonline.com/) so that we can provide you with instructions for removing the extra link. If you are comfortable with CSS, you can use CSS to hide the extra link(s).
